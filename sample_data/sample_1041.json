[{"body": "\n\nintroduction\nthe sycamore lace bug, corythucha ciliata (say) (hemiptera: tingidae), is an invasive insect species that originated from the eastern and central regions of north america1. it spread to italy in 19602 and then became widely-distributed throughout europe3. shortly after 1990, it successively invaded south america4, asia5 and australia6. c. ciliata causes damage to sycamore trees by feeding on the foliage, thus reducing photosynthesis and promoting disease. once established, it can form fairly stable, high density populations7\u201310. c. ciliata has become a primary pest of trees in the genus platanus\n11\u201313, and effective controls are lacking during widespread outbreaks14. for example, c. ciliata caused serious damage throughout europe in the 1980\u2009s, and this resulted in the formation of a special working group to study its biology, ecology, nature enemies and chemical control.\nin china, c. ciliata was first discovered in changsha in 200215 and then in wuhan16, 17. in a relatively short time, it dispersed to at least 23 cities in china and to the yangtze river basin17\u201320. why is c. ciliata so successful in invading new places? it is helpful to note that this insect has a strong reproductive capacity, and adult females can produce 250\u2013350 eggs20. secondly, c. ciliata can withstand both high and low temperature extremes. in laboratory experiments, the ltemp50 and ltemp90 of c. ciliata adults and nymphs were 41.4\u2009\u00b0c and 43.8\u2009\u00b0c, respectively, after one hour of high temperature stress21. c. ciliata adults can also survive after exposure to very low temperatures; e.g. \u221223.3\u2009\u00b0c. additionally, c. ciliata is easily dispersed; although its wings are relatively weak, it can migrate thousands of meters via wind currents22 and has been extensively disseminated by human activity1. for example, it may have spread from north america to italy as a result of the shipping industry10. in turkey, c. ciliata has dispersed to large cities located along highways23, which indicates that human transportation is a major factor in dissemination. finally, the host trees, platanus spp., are widely planted in urban areas. c. ciliata has presumably co-evolved with platanus spp.24, which contains seven tree species originating from north america, europe, and asia.\nmitochondrial dna sequences and microsatellites are frequently used to investigate the genetic structure of populations25\u201327, and the combined use of these two genetic markers may result in more accurate information than that obtained from a single marker28. in the present study, three mtdna genes (cytochrome c oxidase subunit i, coi), nadh dehydrogenase subunits 1 and 5 (nd1 and nd5) and nine microsatellite loci were used to study the genetic structure of 21 chinese and two european populations of c. ciliata. the primary goals of this study were to: (1) investigate the genetic structure and diversity of c. ciliata populations in china and europe; (2) identify the potential routes of dispersal in china; (3) define the demographic profile associated with the expansion of c. ciliata; and (4) analyze the genetic and environmental factors contributing to the invasiveness of c. ciliata.\n\n\nresults\n\ngenetic diversity\nusing the mitochondrial markers, five haplotypes (h1\u2013h5) were identified for coi, nd1 and nd5 (fig.\u00a01) (genbank accession numbers: kp420509-kp420523). parameters of genetic diversity were calculated for the 23 populations based on concatenated sequences (table\u00a01), and coi, nd1, and nd5 sequences independently (supplementary table\u00a0s1). the number of haplotypes per population (n) ranged from 1\u20136, 1\u20133, 1\u20132 and 1\u20133 in concatenated sequences, coi, nd1, and nd5, respectively. haplotype diversity (h) ranged from 0.000\u20130.889, 0.000\u20130.711, 0.000\u20130.533, and 0.000\u20130.644 in concatenated sequences, coi, nd1 and nd5, respectively. based on concatenated sequences, the h values of the zj and sv populations were the highest (h\u2009=\u20090.889) and the gy, wh, yz and yc populations were the lowest (h\u2009=\u20090.000) (table\u00a01). in addition, nucleotide diversity (\u03c0) ranged from 0.00000\u20130.00376, 0.00000\u20130.00733, 0.00000\u20130.00249 and 0.00000\u20130.00356 in concatenated sequences, coi, nd1 and nd5, respectively. the \u03c0 values were highest for the zj population (\u03c0\u2009=\u20090.00376) and lowest for the gy, wh, yz and yc populations (\u03c0\u2009=\u20090.00000) based on the concatenated sequences (table\u00a01). we also analyzed the genetic diversity of the g1, g2, g3, and g4 groups (identified by samova analysis, see below) based on the concatenated sequences. the h value of g4 was higher than the other three groups (g1, g2, g3), and the \u03c0 values for g3 and g4 were much higher than g1 and g2 (supplementary table\u00a0s1).figure 1collection sites in china and haplotype distribution in each population.

p\u2009=\u20090.0019 for a).\na total of 552 individuals representing the 23 populations were genotyped with the nine microsatellite markers (table\u00a01). the average number of allelic richness (ar) for each population ranged from 4.29 (gy, ja, yc and xz) to 7.06 (sv and it). the average number of alleles (a) for each population ranged from 4.56 (wh, zz, yc, and ja) to 7.67 (sv and it). the average observed heterozygosity (ho) ranged from 0.47\u20130.77, mean expected heterozygosity (he) was 0.50\u20130.75, and the average inbreeding index (fis) ranged from \u22120.17 to 0.28. we also analyzed two groups (gi and gii, identified by structure analysis, please see below), and the genetic diversity of gi was lower than gii (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) (supplementary table\u00a0s4). fisher\u2019s exact test for hardy-weinberg equilibrium (hwe) across loci and populations indicated that all 23 populations, and the nine microsatellite loci showed significant deviation from hwe (supplementary tables\u00a0s2 and s3). besides, no pair of loci showed significant linkage disequilibrium.\n\n\npopulation genetic structure\nwith respect to concatenated mtdna sequences, samova analysis indicated that the fct value was highest (0.77243) when k was four; consequently, the 23 populations were divided into four groups designated g1, g2, g3 and g4. g1 included the following populations: hf, ycc, gy, wh, hy, zz, cs, tc, yc, ja, cd, hz, xa, yw, sv and it. g2 included nj and yz, g3 contained ly, sq, xz and ta, and g4 consisted of a single population, zj. although g3 was an exception, the occurrence of g1, g2, and g4 was not consistent with geographic distribution.\namova analysis revealed that over 73% of the variation occurred between groups; variation was relatively small within groups and within populations for the concatenated sequences, coi, nd1, and nd5 (table\u00a02). furthermore, amova revealed that significant genetic structure occurred in c. ciliata at various hierarchical levels (among groups, among populations within groups, and within populations) (p\u2009<\u20090.05) (table\u00a02).table 2partitioning of genetic variation at different hierarchical levels.group numbersgene analyzedsource of varationd.f.sum of squaresvariance componentspercentage of varationfixation indecesk\u2009=\u20094concatenated sequencesamong groups4375.9153.00594 va76fct\u2009=\u20090.76001**among populations within groups1833.120.09898 vb2.5fsc\u2009=\u20090.10427**within populations2071760.85024 vc21.5fst\u2009=\u20090.78503**coiamong groups4169.1541.36290 va76.54fct\u2009=\u20090.76538**among populations within groups189.2280.01054 vb0.59fsc\u2009=\u20090.02524*within populations20784.30.40725 vc22.87fst\u2009=\u20090.77130**nd1among groups471.350.56829 va73.88fct\u2009=\u20090.73876**among populations within groups187.5280.02414 vb3.14fsc\u2009=\u20090.12014**within populations20736.60.17681 vc22.99fst\u2009=\u20090.77015**nd5among groups4136.0361.08167 va76.85fct\u2009=\u20090.76855**among population within groups1816.1010.06356 vb4.52fsc\u2009=\u20090.19513**within populations20654.0110.26219 vc18.63fst\u2009=\u20090.81371**k\u2009=\u20092microsatelliteamong groups172.3580.12226 va11.68fct\u2009=\u20090.11678**among population within groups21104.9810.08669 vb8.28fsc\u2009=\u20090.09375**within populations1081905.8540.83798 vc80.04fst\u2009=\u20090.19958***indicated p\u2009<\u20090.05;

(a) inference of the number of genetic clusters (k) for c. ciliata populations. (b) proportion of genome of each individual assigned to each of the two clusters. each individual is represented by a vertical bar.\n\naccording to the two clusters assigned by structure, amova suggested that significant genetic structure was present for c. ciliata at various hierarchical levels (between groups, among populations within groups, and within populations) (table\u00a02). a high level of differentiation (80.04%, f\nst\u2009=\u20090.19958**) was found within populations based on microsatellites, which was different from mtdna analysis where a high level of differentiation was found between groups.\nthe genetic differentiation among 23\u2009c. ciliata populations was estimated by pairwise fst values between populations based on concatenated mtdna sequences and microsatellite data (supplementary table\u00a0s5). fst values varied from \u22120.09 to 1.00 for concatenated mtdna sequences and from \u22120.02 to 0.32 for microsatellite data. the differentiation between populations was significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05 and p\u2009<\u20090.01) (supplementary table\u00a0s5). wright (1938)29 assumed that 0.05\u2009<\u2009fst\u2009<\u20090.15 represented a moderate level of genetic differentiation; whereas 0.15\u2009<\u2009fst\u2009<\u20090.25 and fst\u2009>\u20090.25 indicated a high level of genetic differentiation. thus, c. ciliata groups possess obvious genetic differentiation (table\u00a03). we also noticed that the values for individual populations are not high for microsatellites but is high for some populations from mtdna data. usually, mitochondrial introgression from a close species, male-biased dispersal, demographic expansion or selection on mtdna were considered as the main reasons for the mito-nuclear (microsatellite) discordance. in the present study, selection may be the cause of the observed discrepancy, and may have differential effects on genetic markers. loci experiencing balancing selection may have allele frequencies more similar than expected under neutrality, reducing the diversity estimates, whereas selection pressure on mtdna may accelerate the coalescence of lineages, and thus increase the levels of differentiation.table 3the f\nst value between the groups based on concatenated sequences.groupg1g2g3g4g10.00000\u2009\u00b1\u20090.000000.00000\u2009\u00b1\u20090.000000.00000\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00000g20.718870.00000\u2009\u00b1\u20090.000000.00000\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00000g30.873090.904270.00000\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00000g40.684880.378940.59516fst of four groups of c. ciliata (below the diagonal);

(ii) yw and hy; (iii) ycc and tc; (iv) cd and hz; (v) sq and xz; (vi) nj and yz; and (vii) sv and it. some population clusters were consistent with the group assignment (g2 and g3) as defined in samova; examples include the cluster represented by ta, ly, sq and xz and the cluster containing yz and nj. it is noteworthy that the european populations sv and it were closely related to the populations from eastern china represented by zj, ta, ly, sq, xz, nj and yz.figure 3nj tree inferred from the concatenated mtdna sequences.\n\nadditionally, we constructed a nj tree for coi sequences of 25 populations. this included the 23 populations listed in table\u00a01 and two additional populations from canada (cn) and germany (gm), which were obtained from genbank (fig.\u00a04). in the phylogenetic tree, the clusters among populations were consistent with nei\u2019s genetic distance. according to the nj tree, we found the same population clusters (nj and yz; zj, ta, ly, sq, xz) with the defined groups of the concatenated mtdna sequences. the sv and it populations were not sister groups, whereas the cn and gm populations were sisters. in the nj tree, we also observed two clusters. in cluster 1, the sv population grouped with 11 chinese populations. in cluster 2, the it, gm and cn populations grouped with the remaining ten chinese populations. the genetic diversity of cluster 2 was higher than cluster 1 although it is not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.1124 for h and p\u2009=\u20090.1831 for \u03c0).figure 4nj tree inferred from the coi sequences.\n\nwe also constructed a nj tree from microsatellite data (fig.\u00a05). analysis indicated the presence of two primary clusters among the 23 populations, and the distribution was consistent with nei\u2019s genetic distance. when we compared the nj tree derived from mtdna sequences with the dendogram obtained for microsatellites, the cluster formed by the gy, wh, zz, yc and ja populations was conserved. the sister groups (sv and it; nj and yz; cd and hz; yw and hy; and ycc and tc) were also preserved (figs\u00a03 and 4).figure 5nj tree inferred from multilocus microsatellites.\n\n\n\ngene flow and isolation by distance\nthe effective mutation scaled population size (\u03b8) was estimated for each population and group based on concatenated mtdna sequences and microsatellite data. the bidirectional mutation-scaled immigration rate (m) was estimated for 253 population pairs (supplementary tables\u00a06 and 7). the m ranged from 282.0 (zz\u2009\u2192\u2009zj) to 777.3 (cs\u2009\u2192\u2009gy), which indicated high gene flow (\u03b8\u2009*\u2009m) between population pairs with concatenated mtdna sequences. furthermore, 22 population pairs (8.7%) showed asymmetric migration rates (supplementary table\u00a0s6).\nwith respect to the four groups identified by mtdna analysis, m varied from 226.2 (g1\u2009\u2192\u2009g3) to 742.2 (g4\u2009\u2192\u2009g2) (table\u00a04). there were no asymmetric migration rates between group pairs. more importantly, the migrants from the eastern regions (including g2, g3 and g4) to the western regions (g1) were high (table\u00a04).table 4estimates of gene flow between four corythucha ciliata groups based on concatenated mtdna sequences.group, i\u03b8group1 g1\u2009\u2192\u2009igroup 2 g2\u2009\u2192\u2009igroup 3 g3\u2009\u2192\u2009igroup 4 g4\u2009\u2192\u2009ig10.00226 (0.00033\u20130.00412)444.9 (0.0\u2013898.7)475.7 (0.0\u2013922.0)471.5 (0.0\u2013876.7)g20.00086 (0.00000\u20130.00253)421.3 (53.3\u2013855.3)467.7 (0.0\u2013861.3)742.2 (285.3\u20131000.0)g30.00041 (0.00000\u20130.00207)226.2 (0.0\u2013578.7)325.3 (0.0\u2013808.7)739.4 (329.3\u20131000.0)g40.02890 (0.00000\u20130.07973)316.1 (0.0\u2013750.7)427.6 (0.0\u2013852.0)441.9 (0.0\u2013852.7)\u03b8: mutation scaled effective population size;

fig.\u00a06a and table\u00a05). the second step of abc analysis was intended to assess genetic relationships of the three most likely sources of introduction (g2, g3 and g4). scenario testing analyses of the relationships among the three eastern groups suggested that g4 developed from an admixture of g2 and g3 (logistic regression: 0.6023 [95% ci: 0.5359\u20130.6688]) (scenario 4;

models, we used the wilcoxon test to analyze whether the heterozygosity excess was significant. two populations (cs and ta) and one population (xz) had a statistically significant excess of heterozygotes when analyzed using the infinite allele model (iam) and two-phased model of mutation (tpm), respectively (table\u00a07). however, heterozygosity excess was observed in 12 populations (hf, gy, wh, zz, cs, ly, nj, sq, xz, yz, yc and ja) using the step-wise mutation model (smm, table\u00a07), suggesting that most c. ciliata populations in this study underwent a genetic bottleneck.table 7bottleneck test for corythucha ciliata based on microsatellites.populationiamtpmsmmhde/hexwilcoxon signle-rank testhde/hexwilcoxon signle-rank testhde/hexwilcoxon signle-rank

mtdna sequences and nine microsatellites, we conclude that the genetic diversity of c. ciliata populations in china is relatively low (mean values of h, \u03c0 and a are 0.447, 0.00080 and 5.59, respectively) and generally less than the diversity exhibited in european populations (p\u2009=\u20090.2422 for h; p\u2009=\u20090.0019 for a) (table\u00a01 and supplementary table\u00a0s1). invasiveness of a species is often associated with a loss in genetic diversity, which may explain these findings34\u201337. interestingly, the zj population (group 4) exhibited a high level of genetic diversity (h\u2009=\u20090.889 and \u03c0\u2009=\u20090.00376) and a high level of gene flow with the other three groups (9.135 to 21.450). the increased genetic variability due to the admixing between g2 and g3 (fig.\u00a06), along with multiple introductions, may explain the relatively high genetic variability of insects in g4. it is important to mention that zj (zhenjiang) is one of the most important hub cities in eastern china; thus it remains a convenient location for dispersal of c. ciliata via humans and vehicles.\nthe hwe test revealed that the 23 populations significantly deviated from hwe. we analyzed three possible reasons for this deviation by excluding the presence of null alleles. significant deviation from hwe could be caused by inbreeding (fis: \u22120.17\u20130.28), and sampling bias and overlapping generations could result in the inbreeding phenomenon. in support of this, we observed that c. ciliata likes to congregate at feeding sites and exhibits generational overlap after the second generation38. besides, we could not rule out possibility that homozygote excess was related to hwe because most of the loci had a tendency to slight homozygote excess (table\u00a01).\n\n\ngenetic structure and dispersal of c. ciliata in china\nwe discovered that c. ciliata exhibits obvious genetic structure in china based on structure analysis. samova indicated that the 23 populations were defined as four groups based on mtdna sequences, and amova indicated that significant genetic differentiation existed among groups, among populations within groups, and within populations. additionally, the nj tree revealed a pattern of genetic differentiation similar to the samova analysis. conversely, structure analysis indicated that the 23 populations formed two clusters based on microsatellites; amova results showed significant genetic differentiation among groups, among populations within groups, and within populations. the nj tree based on microsatellites revealed genetic differentiation similar to structure analysis. the pairwise fst values also indicated that the chinese populations of c. ciliata have obvious genetic differentiation. moreover, genetic differentiation was not caused by geographic isolation because genetic and geographic distances were not correlated.\nthe direction of asymmetric gene flow can potentially reveal migration patterns and routes of invasion. our analysis of gene flow indicated that c. ciliata migrated from the eastern regions (e.g. g2, g3 and g4) to the western regions of china (g1) (table\u00a04). furthermore, abc analyses indicated that the most likely scenario regarding the invasion of c. ciliata was a complex situation involving admixture and split. more specifically, g4 (zj) was an admixture derived from g2 and g3, which was then introduced to inland china (g3). this route of invasion is supported by the fact that sycamore trees were transplanted to china. thus, we hypothesize that c. ciliata invaded china from seaports located along the east coast, possibly due to the importation of sycamore trees. however, it is important to note that our hypotheses are somewhat inconsistent with the initial reports of c. ciliata in changsha15 and wuhan16, 17, which are inland cities.\nsome populations located in eastern china (e.g. zj) exhibited a high level of genetic diversity. these populations exhibit an asymmetric migration relative to other populations and have a slighter higher genetic diversity in mtdna than other populations (mean value of h: 0.517\u2009>\u20090.414, p\u2009=\u20090.2411). this is likely to be another example of the bridgehead effect39, which was predicted to be a common occurrence40 and formed the bridgehead populations that act as a source of western populations in china. the bridgehead effect which refers to widespread secondary invasions stemming from a particular primary invasive population has been observed for the dispersal patterns of several invasive insects, including frankliniella occidentalis\n41 the fire ant solenopsis invicta\n42 and the western corn rootworm, diabrotica virgifera virgifera\n43.\nin summary, these analyses provide compelling evidence that the invasion of c. ciliata started in eastern china and likely spread inland from eastern coastal areas.\n\n\ndemographic history of c. ciliata\nthe analysis of tajima\u2019s d and fu\u2019s fs values and mismatch distributions indicated that chinese populations of c. ciliata fit the neutral evolution model and have not undergone a recent population expansion. most of the d and fs values were positive, which suggests that c. ciliata underwent a population reduction and wide migration or a recent bottleneck effect. this hypothesis is supported by several findings reported in this paper. for example, the overall genetic diversity for chinese populations of c. ciliata was not high based on analysis of mtdna genes and microsatellite data. additionally, analysis of gene flow showed that the average migration rate between populations was high. finally, the microsatellite data indicated that most populations experienced a bottleneck effect.\n\n\ninvasiveness of c. ciliata and implications for management\nit is important to ask why c. ciliata can successfully invade a new location despite low genetic diversity and wide migration or a recent bottleneck effect. our study provides clues to address these questions from the standpoint of population genetics and environmental factors. first, chinese populations of c. ciliata have population structure at different levels. additionally, gene flow is higher between some pairs of populations and groups based on mitochondrial genes. this could be attributed to multiple introductions of c. ciliata in eastern coastal areas of china and subsequent dissemination. repeated introductions or colonization of a given area from multiple sources can negate the decrease in genetic variability associated with colonization or rescue a species from an actual loss in genetic diversity37. abc analyses indicated that the c. ciliata invasion started with the g2 and g3 groups independently and then evolved into g4. with respect to environmental factors and dissemination, it is noteworthy that c. ciliata can colonize and invade many different environments (fig.\u00a07).\nin conclusion, the analyses of genetic diversity and population structure for c. ciliata conducted in this study provide a better understanding of the adaptability of this important pest. c. ciliata is adept at successfully invading new locations, which may be helpful in formulating more effective control measures for this invasive species.\n\n\n\nmaterials and methods\n\nsampled populations and dna extractions\nin this study, c. ciliata adults (females and males) were collected from leaves of platanus spp. in 23 urban locations, including italy and slovenia. the 21 chinese populations (fig.\u00a01 and table\u00a08) encompassed most of the regions infested with c. ciliata. adult samples of c. ciliata were preserved in 100% ethanol and stored at \u221220\u2009\u00b0c. genomic dna was extracted from individual samples using dnavzol (bioteke, beijing, china) and stored at \u221220\u2009\u00b0c until needed for pcr.table 8the information of

fragments of the mitochondrial genome (631, 751 and 786\u2009bp of coi, nd1 and nd5, respectively) were amplified using dna from 10 individuals per population. primer pairs included coi-f (5\u2032ggtcaacaaatcataaagatattgg) and coi-r (5\u2032-taaacttcagggtgaccaaaaaatca)44, nd1-f (5\u2032-attcagactctccttcagca) and nd1-r (5\u2032-ggataacagcctaatcttct), and nd5-f (5\u2032-aaaatcacctcaactatcat) and nd5-r (5\u2032-gctcctacaccagtttcttc). primers for nd1 and nd5 were designed based on the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of c. ciliata\n45. conditions for pcr amplification were as follows: initial denaturation for 5\u2009min at 95\u2009\u00b0c, followed by 35 cycles at 94\u2009\u00b0c (1\u2009min each), annealing for 1\u2009min at 45\u201350\u2009\u00b0c, elongation for 1\u20133\u2009min (depending on predicted fragment length) at 68\u2009\u00b0c, and a final extension step at 72\u2009\u00b0c for 10\u2009min. amplification products were purified and then sequenced by invitrogen biotechnology co. (shanghai, china).\n\n\namplification of microsatellites and determination of fragment size\nthe nine microsatellite loci, primer sequences, and pcr conditions used in the current study were previously described by yang et al.\n46. amplifications were conducted using dna from 24 individuals per population (total number\u2009=\u2009552). amplified pcr products were analyzed by sangon biotechnology co. (shanghai, china) using the abi 3730 automated dna sequencer (applied biosystems). genemapper v. 3.5 (applied biosystems) was used to obtain allele designations.\n\n\nanalysis of diversity and population structure\nfragments comprising the three mitochondrial genes were initially aligned using clustalx v. 2.047. the number of variable sites and haplotypes, haplotype diversity, and nucleotide diversity of the three mtdna genes (coi, nd1 and nd5) were calculated by dnasp v. 5.048. the expected and observed heterozygosity, polymorphic information content, and estimated null frequency were calculated for each locus in individual populations using cervus v. 3.0.349.\nthe number of alleles (a), allelic richness (ar), inbreeding index (fis), and observed and expected heterozygosity (ho and he) were calculated by fstat v. 2.9.3.250. the deviation from hardy-weinberg equilibrium for each population and linkage disequilibrium for pairs of loci was calculated with genepop v. 3.451, and p values were adjusted using the sequential bonferroni procedure52. null alleles were identified using micro-checker v. 2.2.353. t-tests were used to evaluate the significance of differences in diversity estimates haplotype diversity (h), nucleotide diversity (\u03c0) and number of alleles (a) of the populations using jmp v.12.\npopulation groups were identified using concatenated sequences of the three mtdna genes; information on longitude and latitude were included, and the data were analyzed using samova v. 1.054. the most likely number of clusters (k) was determined by repeating the analysis with k ranging from 2 to 6 and selecting the subdivision scheme associated with the highest fct. the clustering of individuals from all populations was determined using structure v. 2.055. the most supported number of clusters (k) was obtained based on multilocus microsatellite data. we used an admixture ancestry model and the correlated allele frequency model with a burn-in period of 100,000 iterations and 1,000,000 markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) repetitions to calculate the most likely number of genetic clusters. we performed 10 independent runs for each k to confirm consistency across runs, tested k from 1 to 8, and used the \u03b4k method of evanno et al.56 to choose the most supported value of k.\nanalysis of molecular variance (amova) was implemented by arlequin v. 3.057. the definition of groups in amova was determined by samova and structure analysis for mtdna sequences and microsatellite data, respectively. pairwise fst (differentiation index) was analyzed by arlequin v. 3.057.\nthe correlation between genetic [fst/(1\u2009\u2212\u2009fst)] and geographic distance matrices in log scale58 was performed using the isolation by distance web service (ibdws)59 with 10,000 randomizations.\n\n\ngene flow analysis and median joining networks of haplotypes\nthe gene flow between pairs of populations and groups was estimated by migrate v. 3.2.160. we used a bayesian search strategy with the following parameters: three long chains (1,000,000 trees) with 10,000 trees discarded in the initial \u201cburn-in\u201d; replicates\u2009=\u2009yes, 5; randomtree\u2009=\u2009yes; and heating\u2009=\u2009adaptive: 1 {1.0 1.2 1.5 3.0}. the migrate program was conducted for four cycles, and the seed number was changed for each run.\nmedian-joining (mj) networks of haplotypes for the three mtdna genes were constructed using network v. 4.661, 62.\n\n\nscenarios of abc analyses\nto explore models that best describe the demographic history and geographic distribution of present-day populations, we evaluated the posterior probabilities of historical scenarios using the approximate bayesian computation approach (abc)30 as implemented in diy abc v. 2.1.031. gene flow analyses revealed that migrants moved from the eastern regions (including g2, g3 and g4) to western china (g1). therefore, to simplify scenarios for abc analysis, we first combined the three groups from eastern regions and then tested two alternative scenarios for potential sources in china (fig.\u00a06a). a total of six scenarios were considered with respect to population size, split, and admixture events for c. ciliata in eastern inland regions (fig.\u00a06b).\n\n\ndemographic analysis and bottleneck effects\nthe mismatch distribution in arlequin v. 3.0 was used for demographic analysis, and tajima\u2019s d and fu\u2019s fs tests were implemented to analyze neutrality. effective population size before expansion (\u03b80), effective population size after expansion (\u03b81), population expansion time (\u03c4), and the sum of squared deviation (ssd) between observed and expected mismatches were also calculated. the significance of these statistics was tested by parametric bootstrapping (1,000 replicates) in arlequin v. 3.0.\nbottleneck effects were detected using bottleneck v. 3.463. analyses were based on the frequency of each allele with the following three models: the infinite allele model (iam)64; the step-wise mutation model (smm)65, and the two-phased model of mutation (tpm)66. the number of iterations for bottleneck was 1,000, and the wilcoxon sign-rank test was implemented.\nin all instances where multiple tests were conducted simultaneously, the sequential bonferroni procedure52 was applied to adjust the nominal significance level.\n\n\nphylogenetic reconstruction\npairwise fst values for populations were calculated using arlequin v. 3.0 with 1,000 permutations. nj phylogenetic trees were generated using phylip v. 3.267 and based on nei\u2019s genetic distance. the nj tree was constructed using coi sequences from the 23 populations listed in table\u00a01 and two additional populations from germany (gm) and canada (cn); the latter sequences were obtained from genbank.\n\n\nmaxent modeling algorithm\nto estimate the environmental suitability of areas for c. ciliata invasion, we built a species distribution model (sdm) based on field observations of c. ciliata occurrences coupled with environmental maps. data from sites known to be infested with c. ciliata in china were entered into maxent32. nineteen bioclimatic data layers were acquired from the worldclim dataset (http://www.worldclim.org/)68 at a spatial resolution of 2.5 arc minutes. the random test percentage was set to 25%, and the jackknife procedure was used to estimate the contribution of each variable based on performance of the model. the area under the curve (auc) value was calculated for model validation; auc reflects the model\u2019s ability to distinguish between present records and random background points. auc values ranged from 0.5 (not different from a randomly-selected predictive distribution) to 1 (with perfect predictive ability). models having auc values\u2009>\u20090.9 were considered to have very good, >0.8 good, and >0.7 useful discrimination abilities69. the final map was visualized and processed using the arcgis platform (http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis).\n\n\n\nelectronic supplementary material\n\n\nsupplementary materials\n\n\n\n", "abstract": "\n\ncorythucha ciliata (say), an invasive pest originating from north america, causes severe damage on sycamore trees. however, little is known about the population genetics and evolutionary forces underlying the invasiveness of this important pest. in the present study, we use three mitochondrial genes (coi, nd1 and nd5) and nine microsatellite markers to investigate the population genetics of c. ciliata and retrace its spread through china. the results suggest a low level of genetic diversity in chinese and european populations of c. ciliata. our results indicate that populations of c. ciliata have obvious genetic structure, and genetic differentiation is not caused by geographic isolation. in median-joining networks, we observed a higher frequency of shared haplotypes in groups 1 and 3. based on gene flow and approximate bayesian computation analyses, we discovered that c. ciliata first invaded the east coast of china and subsequently moved inland. demographic analysis suggested that populations of c. ciliata in china may have undergone a recent bottleneck effect. finally, our results suggest that population structure, high gene flow and environmental conditions have favored the broad invasiveness of this important pest.\n"}]
