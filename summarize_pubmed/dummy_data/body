\nstroke being leading cause of death, acquired disability in developed and developing countries,[1] with 87% ischemic strokes.[2] cerebral ischemia is characterized by insufficient blood flow to the brain that leads to cerebral hypoxia and causes an infarction/ischemic stroke. cells cannot maintain electrochemical gradients leading to massive influx of calcium, excessive release of glutamate from synaptic vesicles, lipolysis, calpain activation, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress. the caspase-dependent apoptosis cascade is initiated. blood-brain barrier disruption occurs and leads to vasogenic edema, a primary cause of stroke-associated mortality.[3] reperfusion of ischemic tissues is associated with microvascular injury. activated endothelial cells produce more reactive oxygen species (ros) but less nitric oxide following reperfusion, and the imbalance results in a subsequent inflammatory response.[4] leukocytes, carried to the area by the newly returning blood, release a host of inflammatory factors such as interleukins as well as free radicals in response to tissue damage.[5] the restored blood flow reintroduces oxygen within cells that damages cellular proteins, dna, and plasma membrane. reactive species may act indirectly in redox signaling to turn on apoptosis.[6] transgenic models with antioxidants overexpressed provided neuroprotection.[7] flavonoids interfere nitric oxide synthase and xanthine oxidase pathway.[8]\npentapetes phoenicea (l) is an erect, half-woody plant, belonging to the family malvaceae.[9] it is commonly known as scarlet mallow or midday flower in english. in india, decoction of leaves was drunk for inflammatory glands. juice is also applied to inflammatory glands.[10] it also alleviates psychopathy and central nervous system ailments. the presence of rutin in the hydroalcoholic extract of p. phoenicea plant was confirmed with the help of high performance thin layer chromatography studies.[11] in vitro antiradical activity was reported.[12] therefore, in view of ethnopharmacological facts of the plant, the present study investigated the cerebroprotective activity of methanolic extract (me) of p. phoenicea.\n\nmaterials and methods\n\nchemicals and drugs\nglutathione (gsh), sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds), acetic acid, thiobarbituric acid (tba), reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate

(300\u2013350 g) were obtained from the national institute of nutrition, hyderabad. they were randomly housed in polypropylene cages, maintained in 12:12 light:dark cycle, and given access to food and water ad libitum. the experiments on animals were approved by the institutional animal ethical committee (iaec) under the regulation of cpcsea (iaec approval no. mrcp/cpcsea/iaec/2012-13/pcol/16). all surgeries were performed under the thiopental sodium (40 mg/kg) anesthesia to minimize animal suffering.\n\n\nplant material collection\np. phoenicea plants were collected from the forests of tirupati during august 2013, were authenticated, and voucher specimen preserved at herbarium section of the department of botany, sri venkateswara university, tirupati.\n\n\nplant extraction\nthe air-dried p. phoenicea plants were powdered and successively extracted with petroleum ether, chloroform, and methanol. petroleum ether and chloroform extracts were discarded. subsequently, the residue was subjected to soxhlation at 55\u00b0c. rotary vacuum evaporator was used under reduced pressure for complete removal of the solvent.\n\n\nexperimental protocol for global ischemia\nanimals were divided

follows:\n\ngroup i: normal saline (10 ml/kg), no ischemia induction (control)group ii: normal saline (10 ml/kg), bilateral carotid artery occlusion (bcao) for 30 min, followed by 4 h reperfusion (vehicle/ischemia)group iii: edaravone (3 mg/kg/day), bcao for 30 min and followed by 4 h reperfusion (standard)group iv: methanolic extract of p. phoenicea (me 100 mg/kg/day), bcao for 30 min, followed by 4 h reperfusiongroup v: methanolic extract of p. phoenicea (me 200 mg/kg/day), bcao for 30 min, followed by 4 h reperfusiongroup vi: methanolic extract of p. phoenicea (me 400 mg/kg/day),

common carotid arteries were located separately step-by-step. the carotid artery was exposed after careful separation from the adjacent vagus nerve, with special attention. a cotton thread was passed below the each carotid artery and a surgical knot put on both arteries for 30 min ischemia induction. after 30 min of global ischemia, the thread was removed to allow reflow of blood through carotid arteries (reperfusion) for 4 h. the body temperature of rats was maintained around 37\u00b0c \u00b1 5\u00b0c throughout the surgical procedure by heated surgical platform. control animals received the

the attenuation of brain damage and reduction of the oxidative stress in i/r-induced rats by p. phoenicea pretreatment.\nthe common carotid artery is the main artery supplying blood from heart to brain, and bcao is the basic experimental model for global cerebral ischemia induction in rats.\nocclusion of both the carotid arteries for 30 min leads to reduction in blood supply to the brain and reperfusion aggravates the neuronal damage initiated by ischemia.[12] reperfusion of ischemic tissues is often associated with microvascular dysfunction that is manifested as impaired endothelium-dependent dilation in arterioles, enhanced fluid filtration and leukocyte plugging in capillaries, and the trafficking of leukocytes and plasma protein extravasation in postcapillary venules. activated endothelial cells in all segments of the microcirculation produce more oxygen radicals.[10]\nit was observed that pretreatment with p. phoenicea attenuated the neuronal damage and oxidative stress. it restored the altered antioxidant enzymes and also reduced the mda and h2o2 production induced by bcao. oxidative stress is one of the important factors that exacerbate the brain damage induced by cerebral ischemia.[13]\nthe presence of many antioxidant enzymes such as cat, gpx, gr, and gst in the brain prevents these tissues from the oxidative damage by free radical formation.[14] among various brain regions, some are more susceptible to brain ischemia due to the high rate of oxidative metabolic activity, intense production of reactive oxygen metabolites, high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, relatively low antioxidant capacity, low repair mechanism activity, and poor plasticity in that areas.[15]\nthe pathophysiology of brain injury includes abrupt neuronal depolarization,[16] release of excitatory neurotransmitters, ionic shifts, changes in glucose metabolism, altered cerebral blood flow, and impaired axonal function. the changes are well understood in experimental models. the neurotoxic pathway in the pathophysiology of stroke alters the antioxidant enzyme levels[17] such as sod, cat, gpx, gr, gst, gsh, and mda, protein content.\nthe endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity of the brain impaired by i/r is particularly important, and measurement of those antioxidant enzymes after reperfusion can assess the vulnerability of the particular areas of the brain.\nthis study reveals that the production of mda was elevated significantly in ischemic brain regions of the rats after 4 h of reperfusion period. the results demonstrated that mda level was markedly reduced with pretreatment of p. phoenicea and inhibited the neuronal damage from propagating lipid peroxidation as a chain reaction. peroxidation of lipid bi-layer was reported after cerebral i/r injury.[18]\nh2o2 is an electrically neutral long lasting reactive species which can pass through cell membranes and is reported to be more stable than superoxide anion, hydroxyl free radical, and other ros. accumulation of h2o2 impairs the mitochondrial function.\ntherefore, h2o2 may persist for a longer time after reperfusion to produce neuronal injury. p. phoenicea pretreatment restored the level of h2o2 in i/r rat's brain to near normal levels. this may lead to increase in endogenous antioxidant enzymes and prevents the neuronal injury. cat is frequently used by cells to rapidly catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 into less-reactive gaseous oxygen and water molecules. superoxide is one of the main ros in the cell. as a consequence, sod serves a key antioxidant role. the physiological importance of sods is illustrated by the severe pathologies evident in mice genetically engineered to lack these enzymes. mice lacking sod2 gene die several days after birth, amid massive oxidative stress.[19] in this study, reduction in sod, cat activity was significantly prevented by p. phoenicea administration.\nin cells, gsh is maintained in the reduced form by the enzyme gr and in turn reduces other metabolites and enzyme systems, such as ascorbate in the gsh-ascorbate cycle, gpxs, and glutaredoxins as well as reacting directly with oxidants produced by h2o2.\ndue to its high concentration and its central role in maintaining the cell's redox state, gsh is one of the most important cellular antioxidants.[20]\nthe activity of gr is used as an indicator for oxidative stress. in i/r control group, the level of gr was significantly reduced. the biochemical function of gpx is to reduce lipid hydroperoxides to their corresponding alcohols and to reduce free h2o2 to water. dysfunction of gpx may result in loss of protective activity exerted by these enzymes and manifested as increased infarction in many studies.[21]\ngsts, previously known as ligandins, are best known for their ability to catalyze the conjugation of the reduced form of gsh to xenobiotic substrates for the purpose of detoxification.\nomega-class gst (gsto) genes, in particular, are associated with neurological diseases such as alzheimer's, parkinson's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; again, oxidative stress is believed to be the culprit, with decreased gsto gene expression resulting in a lowered age of onset for the diseases.[22] in this study, p. phoenicea pretreatment significantly prevented the reduction in gpx, gr, and gst activities.\nbrain edema in ischemia has also been an important parameter to assess the impact on brain damage. cerebral edema occurs as a result of ionic imbalance resulting in the osmotic pressure difference across the cellular membrane. pathophysiology of edema is that neuronal depolarization due to energy failure, with activation of glutamate receptors, which alters ionic gradients of na+, ca2+, cl\u2212, and k+. as glutamate increases in the extracellular space, peri-infarct depolarization occurs. then, as water shifts occur, cells swell resulting cerebral edema. p. phoenicea reversed the effects on brain water content in the ischemia-reperfusion groups as compared to the ischemic group.\nhistopathology of brain sections also supports that p. phoenicea could exert neuroprotection on brain subjected to i/r injury. ttc stains the viable cells of tissue into deep red color whereas the ischemic portion of the tissue with damaged mitochondria remains unstained. the obtained compilation of results indicates that p. phoenicea is effective against stroke-related brain damage in rats and the activity can be implicated to high levels of flavonoid and phenolic content of the plant.\n\n\nconclusion\nmethanolic extract of p. phoenicea could supress neuronal loss of the ischemic brain tissue and it also elicited antioxidant activity in reperfusion induced oxidative stress. the result of the study indicates that pretreatment with p. phoenicea enhances the antioxidant defense against bcao-induced global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and exerts cerebroprotection.\n\nfinancial support and sponsorship\nnil.\n\n\nconflicts of interest\nthere are no conflicts of interest.\n\n\n
