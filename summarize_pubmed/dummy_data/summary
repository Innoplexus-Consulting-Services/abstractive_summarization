initial cell seeding density as one of the culture conditions, has been indicated to have tremendous effect on cell proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix synthesis.aforementioned studies imply that cell density as an impressive factor can promote cell proliferation and differentiation.so far, no literature has revealed the effect of initial cell density on ascs differentiation into sc-like cells.accordingly, the goal of the current study was to investigate the effect of initial cell seeding density on sc-like cells differentiation of ascs.for adipogenic differentiation, subconfluent passage 4 cultures of ascs were incubated in adipogenic induction medium for 2 weeks.experimental groups and differentiation protocol after cell counting, cells were cultivated at three different initial cell densities on separate poly d-lysine coated 25 cm2 flasks overnight and on the next day, were incubated in scs differentiation medium for 14 days as previously described.finally, immunofluorescence, facs analysis and real time rt-pcr were employed for detection of proteins markers and the number of sc-like cells, respectively.immunofluorescence for immunophenotype characterization of differentiated ascs, the scs markers, including s-100 and gfap, were examined.undifferentiated and differentiated ascs at three different initial cell densities were fixed by 4% pfa for 20 minute and permeabilized with 0.05% triton x-100 for 10 minute.for detection of intracellular proteins, cells were permeabilized by ice cold methanol for each sample at 20 c for 10 minutes and then centrifuged and rinsed two times in pbs 1% bsa before staining with primary mouse anti-s100 and anti-gfap and fitc-conjugated secondary antibodies.one way anova was employed to compare the rate of ascs differentiation into sc-like cells at initial cell densities of 2000, 4000 and 8000 cell/cm2.ascs at three initial cell densities were treated with a mixture of glial growth factors for a period of 2 weeks.immunofluorescence demonstrated that a varying number of cells expressed gfap and s100 in all experimental groups of various initial cell densities.discussion the present study demonstrated that a low cell density like 2 103 cells/cm2 resulted in a low rate of sc differentiation while the seeding density of 8 103 cells/cm2 appeared to be more efficient and appropriate, yielding a highest level of sc differentiation and glial markers expression.previously, it was reported that a cocktail of glial growth factors could induce ascs into sc-like cells which had a distinctive morphology and specific markers and promoted nerve regeneration in vivo and in vitro.in fact, scs treated by hrg/fsk in vitro can grow to very high densities; however, the rate of growth is markedly decreased at these densities indicating that a cell density-dependent mechanism such as the production of an autocrine inhibitor or contact inhibition alters the sc responsiveness to mitogen.therefore, it is regarded that hrg/fsk-induced growth of scs in vitro is strongly regulated by cell density.in addition, previous studies have shown that low initial cell density of mscs result in higher cell yields and faster expansion.it seems that high cell density elicited contact inhibition, attenuated cell proliferation and stimulated ascs differentiation towards sc-like cells.
