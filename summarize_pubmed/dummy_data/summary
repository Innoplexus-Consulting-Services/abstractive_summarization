Neoplasms change over time through a process of cell-level evolution, driven by genetic and epigenetic alterations.There is widespread recognition of the importance of these evolutionary and ecological processes in cancer, but to date, no system has been proposed for drawing clinically relevant distinctions between how different tumours are evolving.The Evo- and Eco-indices provide a common lexicon for communicating about how neoplasms change in response to interventions, with potential implications for clinical trials, personalized medicine and basic cancer research.Neoplasms evolve1 3.But between and within cancer types, tumours probably display differences in the dynamics of cancer evolution and ecology, including the rates at which new clones appear and go extinct, how different those clones are from one another and whether they appear in bursts or at a more regular pace.A classification system for the evolution and ecology of neoplasms would provide clinicians and researchers with a foundation for developing better prognostic and predictive assessments of tumour behaviour, such as response to an intervention.The ultimate purpose of a classification system for the evolution and ecology of neoplasms is to provide a descriptive tool by which to improve clinical management with respect to the overall survival and quality of life of the patient.Fourth, the classification system should be general enough to be applied across different types of neoplasm, recognizing that the types of measurement may need to be individualized to a given type of cancer.This framework is based on fundamental theoretical principles underlying evolutionary and ecological dynamics.However, studies have not yet been done to test whether measures of the evolvability of a tumour from a single biopsy sample are sufficient or whether multiple samples substantially improve predictions of clinical outcomes15.For example, a second biopsy from the same patient after therapy may reveal minimal diversity, indicating a recurrent tumour derived from a single clone, or substantial diversity, suggesting intrinsic resistance by the majority of tumour cells.There was widespread agreement at the consensus conference that both the evolutionary dynamics of the neoplastic cells themselves and the microenvironment that defines the ecology of those cells are important in predicting the future behaviour and response of a tumour.To capture this, we have developed a framework for both an evolutionary index that describes the intrinsic evolvability of the neoplastic cell population and an ecological index that describes potential selective pressures imposed by the surrounding microenvironment.Go to:The Evo-indexThe Evo-index is a combination of two fundamental components: the diversity or intratumoural heterogeneity of the neoplasm and how it changes over time.Both diversity and changes in the clonal structure of a tumour over time are objective measures and may be assessed as part of preclinical studies or clinical trials.An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.Object name is nihms939413f1.jpgFigure 1The Evo-index and how it changesa | The evolutionary index is composed of two factors corresponding to heterogeneity over space and heterogeneity over time.The relationship between diversity and clinical outcomes is not universally consistent across different cancer types6,16 and can be complicated.Box 1Important issues in the measurement of diversity in neoplasmsThere are a number of important issues and open questions in the measurement of diversity in neoplasms: How are clones defined?However, Merlo and colleagues found that defining a clone based on selectively advantageous mutations and defining a clone based on evolutionarily neutral mutations both predicted progression to cancer13.Instead of genetics, one could measure diversity based on RNA expression or other phenotypic characteristics169,170.Because selection acts on phenotypes, this may be a better predictor of a the evolvability of a tumour than genetic measures of diversity.Because the primary tumour is often removed and it is the metastases that kill patients, we may have to measure diversity within and between any metastases that can be sampled in order to best predict clinical outcomes2.It is currently difficult to measure many loci or phenotypes at the single-cell level.We currently do not know all the mutations and epigenetic alterations that make a neoplastic cell resistant to a particular therapy, and even those we do know are difficult to detect if they are present in only a small region of the tumour.Theory suggests that targeting cancer cell cooperation should provide weaker selection for resistance than cytotoxic therapies28.It is likely that not all forms of diversity are equal, and future work must test which are clinically relevant.It may be the case that measures of functional diversity or even phenotypic diversity are better predictors of clinical outcomes than measures of genetic diversity, and the ideal measures may vary between tumour types.Measuring diversityOf the four components of the classification framework, the largest number of methods has been developed for measuring diversity 13,25,29.Established measures of differences between microbial communities34 could possibly be applied to measuring differences between biopsy samples.Table 1Measures and assays for the factors that go into the Evo- and Eco-indicesIcon Factor Statistics AssaysHighAn external file that holds a

to measuring diversity in neoplasms, as discussed in BOX 1.If a cell lineage can change suddenly, in what used to be called a macromutation generating a hopeful monster, then that tumour may have a different capacity for evolution compared with a tumour that is constrained to evolve through the slow accumulation of mutations with small phenotypic effects.Detecting and measuring natural selection is likely to be an important component of our future clinical management of cancers.The classification of a neoplasm s change over time will probably need to take into account both the speed at which a tumour acquires genetic or epigenetic alterations, or changes phenotypically, including how fast clones spread by natural selection, as well as the tempo of that change.Thus, resistance mutations, which may be deleterious or neutral in the absence of therapy, can become selectively advantageous for neoplastic cells exposed to therapy54.Measuring change over timeMeasuring change over time is complicated, whether it is genetic or phenotypic change.This statistic provides predictive power independent of the number of clones for predicting progression12,13, supporting the framework of including both diversity and change over time in the Evo-index.If one tumour has a higher mutation rate or has been accumulating genetic alterations for a longer period of time because those cells had a common ancestor, it will have a higher level of genetic divergence than another tumour.One of the primary tools for measuring change over time in evolutionary biology is phylogenetic inference, which reconstructs the history of a neoplasm61,62.Minimally invasive assays, such as sequencing cfDNA from longitudinal blood samples, could reveal the action of natural or artificial selection in patients.Incorporation of the Evo-index into clinical trials can better describe, in evolutionary terms, why interventions fail.By contrast, relapse with less diversity implies a bottleneck effect where only a minority of tumour cells survived the intervention, probably indicating selection for one or a few resistant clones.Go to:The Eco-indexFrom the perspective of an organism or a neoplastic cell, its ecology can be broadly described by two characteristics: hazards and resources 66 69.This is an important point from ecology we can understand the evolution and responses of a population best when we take the perspective of an organism in that population70.An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.Object name is nihms939413f3.jpgOpen in a separate windowFigure 3The Eco-indexsThe ecological index is composed of two factors corresponding to the hazards and resources available to the neoplastic cells.The heterogeneity of resources and hazards across space also has important impacts on the future evolution of cancer cell populations and prognosis for patients73,74.HazardsThere are multiple sources of hazards for neoplastic cells, including immune cells, toxins, waste products, microorganisms and anticancer therapies.These results suggest that immune predation is a major form of hazard for a neoplastic cell, and measures of that predation should be a central component of the ecological index.While much research has investigated the potentially toxic effects of low pH, fewer studies have examined the fitness consequences to cancer cells from various metabolites.Measurements of anticancer drug concentrations in the tumour are also likely to quantify important hazards for the neoplastic cells.Measuring which resources limit the population size and proliferation of neoplastic cells would allow researchers to identify some of the strongest selective pressures on the tumour and to predict how it will change in the future.We have summarized the statistics and assays for measuring diversity, change over time, hazards and resources in TABLE 1.Go to:Categories of tumoursThe future behaviour of a tumour depends on both its evolutionary potential and the selective pressures on the tumour.Dichotomizing each evolutionary and ecological factor of the Evo- and Eco-indices into high and low values would produce 16 possible types of tumour.Table 2An

nihms939413t22.jpgD2 2 H1R2 With potentially the worst prognosis, these genetically diverse tumours are evolving rapidly and have plenty of resources.Resources are abundant, although they are probably being consumed rapidly, and predation from the immune system is extensive.Open in a separate windowD, diversity;, genetic, epigenetic or phenotypic change over time; Eco-index, ecological index; Evo-index, evolutionary index; H, hazards; R, resources.In order to classify a tumour, investigators will first need to define and validate clinically relevant thresholds for dichotomizing diversity, change over time, hazards and resources.Initial studies should test if these classifications significantly predict clinical outcomes and which evolutionary and ecological measures provide independent predictive value.Future studies should test alternative measures of diversity, change over time, hazards and resources to help standardize useful metrics for the classifications.They should also quantify the improvements to prognosis gained by sampling multiple regions at multiple timepoints.Box 2The future of the Evo-indexOur framework for quantifying the evolvability of a neoplasm is based on the diversity within the tumour and how that diversity changes over time.We could use the results to develop guidelines for best practice in managing cancers.An external file that holds a picture,

we could examine how different interventions move tumours between categories.Of course, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy may have different effects depending on the details of those therapies and their interaction with the clones in the tumour and their ecosystem.Go to:Vision of the futureIn the future, the pathology report for a neoplasm could include its Evo-index and Eco-index classifications.Ideally, these classifications would provide chessboard -like scenarios where, based on the current evolutionary class of a tumour, one could anticipate how the tumour type will change with different possible therapeutic moves.
