activated endothelial cells produce more reactive oxygen species but less nitric oxide following reperfusion, and the imbalance results in a subsequent inflammatory response.after completion of reperfusion period, the brains were excised under anesthesia for determination of brain weight biochemical parameters, histopathology, and assessment of cerebral infarct size.\n\n\npreparation of postmitochondrial supernatant\nafter bcao and reperfusion, the animals were sacrificed immediately by decapitation, brains were isolated, washed in precooled 0.9% saline and frozen at \u221220\u00b0c for 15 min, then subsequently blotted on filter paper, weighed, and homogenized in chilled sodium phosphate buffer using a remi tissue homogenizer.the absorbance measured spectrophotometrically at 532 nm using ultraviolet \u2013visible spectrophotometer and the malondialdehyde content was measured from the standard graph of mda and was expressed as nmol/g wet tissue.\n\n\ncatalase\ncatalase activity in tissue was determined by measuring the rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide at 240 nm, according to the method given below.\nto 50 \u00b5l of pms, 1.95 ml phosphate buffer and 1 ml of h2o2 were added to prepare the reaction mixture.then, the mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature and the absorbance was measured at 412 nm in uv\u2013visible spectrophotometer and gsh content was calculated from the standard graph.\n\n\nglutathione reductase\nglutathione reductase activity in the tissue was determined by measuring the decrease in the absorbance caused by oxidation of nadph at 340 nm.the results confirmed that the cerebral ischemia and reperfusion significantly decreased antioxidative activities and increased the level of lipid peroxidation and h2o2 in the injured brain tissue of rats as compared with the control group.phoenicea extract-treated groups exhibited dose-dependent activity with better activity elicited by me 400 mg/kg treated groups.\n\ntable 1\n\neffect of pentapetes phoenicea on antioxidant parameters\n\n\n\n\ntable 2\n\neffect of pentapetes phoenicea on antioxidant parameters\n\n\n\n\n\nprotein content estimation by gel electrophoresis\nthe protein content of the tissue samples was assessed by gel electrophoresis and the results presented in figure 2 indicated that the me and edaravone-treated groups had high protein content when compared with ischemic group.\n\nfigure 2\n\neffect of pentapetes phoenicea on protein content in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion-induced rats.phoenicea treated groups significantly prevented the neuronal loss when compared with ischemic group.\n\nfigure 3\n\neffect of pentapetes phoenicea on histopathological changes in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion-induced rats.sham control group; vehicle + ischemia; edaravone + ischemia; pentapetes phoenicea methanolic extract + ischemia; pentapetes phoenicea methanolic extract + ischemia; pentapetes phoenicea methanolic extract + ischemia\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndiscussion\nthe study revealed the cerebroprotective effect, demonstrated the attenuation of brain damage and reduction of the oxidative stress in i/r-induced rats by p.phoenicea pretreatment.\nthe common carotid artery is the main artery supplying blood from heart to brain, and bcao is the basic experimental model for global cerebral ischemia induction in rats.\nocclusion of both the carotid arteries for 30 min leads to reduction in blood supply to the brain and reperfusion aggravates the neuronal damage initiated by ischemia.13 \nthe presence of many antioxidant enzymes such as cat, gpx, gr, and gst in the brain prevents these tissues from the oxidative damage by free radical formation.the neurotoxic pathway in the pathophysiology of stroke alters the antioxidant enzyme levels 17 such as sod, cat, gpx, gr, gst, gsh, and mda, protein content.\nthe endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity of the brain impaired by i/r is particularly important, and measurement of those antioxidant enzymes after reperfusion can assess the vulnerability of the particular areas of the brain.\nthis study reveals that the production of mda was elevated significantly in ischemic brain regions of the rats after 4 h of reperfusion period.phoenicea pretreatment significantly prevented the reduction in gpx, gr, and gst activities.\nbrain edema in ischemia has also been an important parameter to assess the impact on brain damage.phoenicea is effective against stroke-related brain damage in rats and the activity can be implicated to high levels of flavonoid and phenolic content of the plant.\n\n\nconclusion\nmethanolic extract of p.phoenicea could supress neuronal loss of the ischemic brain tissue and it also elicited antioxidant activity in reperfusion induced oxidative stress.
